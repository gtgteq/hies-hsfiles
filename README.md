# hies template

Haskell Stack template for direnv and HIE, also contains servant and PureScript templates.

Based on new-template.hsfiles and [all-hies](https://github.com/Infinisil/all-hies/tree/master/templates/haskell.nix-stack),
maybe working with [emacs-lsp/lsp-haskell](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-haskell).
